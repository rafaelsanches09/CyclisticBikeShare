Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Welcome to my case study for the Google Data Analytics Certification!

In this project, I take on the role of a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic operates a fleet of over 5,800 bicycles with 600 docking stations across the city.

The goal of this analysis is to help Cyclistic's marketing team understand the differences between casual riders and annual members. The director of marketing believes that increasing the number of annual memberships is key to Cyclisticâ€™s future success, so identifying how these two groups use the service differently is critical.

Project Overview
This analysis follows the six key steps of the data analysis process:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

Each section of this repository will walk you through one step of the process, outlining the methods, tools, and findings. Let's dive in!
